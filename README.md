This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

Let me provide you with a summary of what I've implemented:

## ‚úÖ **Orders Feature Implementation Complete!**

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive orders management system based on your mockup. Here's what's been built:

### **üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture:**

1. **Order Service** (orderService.ts)
   - Complete CRUD operations for KOT orders
   - Hardcoded menu items (Tea, Pasta, Snacks as requested)
   - Order retrieval with customer and item details
   - Auto-generated KOT numbers

2. **Order State Management** (orderState.ts)
   - Observable state for orders, modals, and order creation flow
   - Selected customer and items tracking
   - Modal visibility states

3. **Database Integration**
   - Uses existing SQLite tables (`kot_orders`, `kot_items`)
   - Foreign key relationships with customers and menu items
   - Test data seeding for demonstration

### **üì± UI Components Implemented:**

#### **Main Orders Screen** (orders.tsx)

- **Order List**: Shows all orders (latest first) with KOT numbers
- **Order Cards**: Display customer name, timestamp, total amount, item count
- **Floating Action Button**: Black circular '+' button (exactly like mockup)
- **Empty State**: Helpful message when no orders exist
- **Loading & Error States**: Proper UX handling

#### **Order Details Modal** (OrderDetailsModal.tsx)

- **Order Header**: KOT number, timestamp, customer details
- **Items List**: Each item with icon, name, quantity, price
- **Total Calculation**: Sum of all items
- **Navigation**: Back button to close modal

#### **Create Order Flow**:

**1. New Order Modal** (CreateOrderModal.tsx)

- **Customer Selection**: Button to choose customer
- **Items Section**: Add items button and selected items list
- **Order Summary**: Running total display
- **Place Order**: Disabled until customer and items selected

**2. Select Customer Modal** (SelectCustomerModal.tsx)

- **Search Bar**: Filter customers by name/contact
- **Customer List**: Recent customers with avatars
- **Add New Customer**: Integration with existing customer modal
- **Customer Selection**: Tap to select and return

**3. Select Items Modal** (SelectItemsModal.tsx)

- **Category Tabs**: All, Tea, Pasta, Snacks
- **Search Functionality**: Filter items by name
- **Item Cards**: Food icons, name, price, quantity controls
- **Dynamic Selection**: Add/remove items with quantity

### **üéØ Features Working:**

- ‚úÖ **View Orders**: List all orders with details
- ‚úÖ **Order Details**: Complete order breakdown
- ‚úÖ **Create Orders**: Full flow from customer to items to placement
- ‚úÖ **Customer Integration**: Uses existing customer management
- ‚úÖ **Hardcoded Menu**: Tea (üçµ), Pasta (üçù), Snacks (üçü)
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Updates**: State management keeps UI in sync
- ‚úÖ **Responsive UI**: Clean design matching your mockup

### **üé® UI/UX Highlights:**

- **Exact Mockup Match**: UI closely follows your provided designs
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Back buttons, modal flows, clear CTAs
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading states, disabled buttons, error handling
- **Food Icons**: Emoji icons for different menu categories
- **Clean Typography**: Proper text hierarchy and spacing

### **üóÑÔ∏è Data Structure:**

```typescript
KOT Order:
- KOT Number (auto-generated)
- Customer (linked from customers table)
- Items (with quantities and prices)
- Timestamp
- Total Amount

Menu Items (Hardcoded):
- Lemon Tea: ‚Çπ30
- White Sauce Pasta: ‚Çπ110
- Peri Peri Fries: ‚Çπ100
- Black Tea: ‚Çπ25
```

### **üöÄ Ready to Test:**

Your chaai-point-app now has a fully functional orders system! You can:

1. **Browse Orders**: Tap Orders tab to see existing orders
2. **View Details**: Tap any order to see full breakdown
3. **Create Order**: Tap + button to start new order flow
4. **Select Customer**: Choose from existing or create new
5. **Add Items**: Browse categories and add with quantities
6. **Place Order**: Complete the order and see it in the list

The app should be running with test data including sample orders. Try navigating to the Orders tab and testing the complete flow!

**Next Steps Available:**

- Menu items management (replace hardcoded items)
- Order status tracking
- Bill generation from orders
- Order editing/cancellation
- Integration with POS printer

The foundation is solid and ready for these enhancements! üéâ
